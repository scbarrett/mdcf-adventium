# Enhancements to MDCF's PCA Shutoff App

Collaborative effort between *Kansas State University* and *Adventium Labs* to extend KSU's modeling of an application configured system of medical devices in the context of a medical application platform (MAP). The resulting interoperable system ensures that its patient controlled analgesia infusion pump cannot deliver an overdose of narcotic to a patient: If its monitoring devices report inappropriate physiological readings the app will shut the PCA pump down, preventing further use.
