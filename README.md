# Enhancements to MDCF's PCA Shutoff App

Collaborative effort between *Kansas State University* and *Adventium Labs* to extend KSU's modeling of an application configured system of medical devices in the context of a medical application platform (MAP). The resulting interoperable system ensures that its patient controlled analgesia infusion pump cannot deliver an overdose of narcotic to a patient; shutting the PCA pump down in the event of receiving inappropriate physiological readings from its monitoring devices.
