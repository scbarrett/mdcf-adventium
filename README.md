# Enhancements to MDCF's PCA Shutoff App

Collaborative effort between *Kansas State University* and *Adventium Labs* to extend KSU's modeling of an application configured system of medical devices in the context of a medical application platform (MAP). The resulting interoperable system ensures that its patient controlled analgesia infusion pump cannot deliver an overdose of narcotic. If its monitoring devices measure inappropriate physiological responses in the patient, the app will shut the PCA pump down, preventing further use.
