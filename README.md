# Enhancements to MDCF's PCA Shutoff App

Collaborative effort between Kansas State University and Adventium Labs to extend KSU's modeling of medical devices and an overseeing application running on a medical application platform (MAP). The resulting interoperable system ensures that a patient controlled analgesia infusion pump does not deliver an overdose of narcotic to the patient by shutting the PCA pump off in the event of inappropriate physiological readings being reported by the medical devices.
